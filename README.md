## ⚡ /root/About_Me

Hi, I'm **Luis Lázaro Pimentel**, a Developer based in **Madrid, Spain**. 

Unlike typical web developers, my passion lies in what happens *under the hood*. I specialize in **System Programming (C)**, **Network Security**, and **Data Architecture**. I build software that is not only functional but secure and optimized at the memory level.

Currently expanding my arsenal in **Penetration Testing** and **Secure Coding Standards**.
